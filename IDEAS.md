# Ideas

This file is a place to jot down ideas for future instruction templates, guidelines, or enhancements to the existing copilot-instructions repository.

## Unprocessed Thoughts
- Spec Kit doesn't always write tasks in a way that follows TDD, so it might be good inject TDD principles into the template, agent, or prompt.
- Include a background step and a discovery step in the spec kit process
  - Background step: Summarize current state of the project based on available documentation (docs/, README.md, specs/, etc.)
  - Discovery step: Fact finding mission to support the specification process; primarily looking into sample input and output data, asking questions about edge cases, and clarifying requirements
